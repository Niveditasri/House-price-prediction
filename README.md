# 🏠 House Price Predictor

This project is a machine learning-based House Price Predictor that estimates property prices using features like location, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and more. It leverages Python and key ML libraries to provide accurate predictions, aiding real estate stakeholders in making data-driven decisions.

## 📌 Features

* Predicts house prices based on input features
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights
* Data preprocessing and feature engineering
* Model training with regression algorithms
* Performance evaluation using metrics like MAE, RMSE
* Easy-to-use, extendable Jupyter Notebook format

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Navigate into the project folder:

   cd house-price-predictor

2. Install required libraries:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

   jupyter notebook House\_Price\_predictor.ipynb

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains various attributes of homes (e.g., number of rooms, area, location). It should be placed in the same directory or updated in the notebook path.

## 📈 Model Training

* Trained using Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
* Evaluated using Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R² Score
* Selected the best model based on performance

## 🤖 Future Improvements

* Web interface for user-friendly predictions
* Integration with real-time real estate databases
* Improved feature selection and model optimization
